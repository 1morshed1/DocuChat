# Implementation Details

This RAG chatbot implementation uses several key technologies to provide a robust and efficient solution.

## Core Components

### LangChain

LangChain is used to orchestrate the various components of the RAG system:

- Document loading and processing
- Text splitting for optimal chunking
- Integration with the language model
- Conversation memory management

### Google Gemini

The chatbot uses Google's Gemini model for generating responses. Gemini is a powerful language model that can understand and generate human-like text.

### ChromaDB

Chroma is used as the vector database to store document embeddings. This allows for efficient similarity search when retrieving relevant documents.

### HuggingFace Embeddings

The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from HuggingFace is used to create embeddings of the documents. This is a lightweight yet effective model for creating document embeddings.

## System Workflow

1. **Document Loading**: Documents are loaded from the knowledge base directory.
2. **Text Splitting**: Documents are split into chunks for better retrieval.
3. **Embedding Creation**: Each chunk is converted to an embedding using the HuggingFace model.
4. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.
5. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question:
   - The question is converted to an embedding
   - Similar document chunks are retrieved from ChromaDB
   - The question and retrieved context are sent to Gemini
   - Gemini generates a response based on the context
6. **Response Generation**: The response is returned to the user through the Gradio interface.

## Visualization

The system includes a visualization feature that uses t-SNE to create a 2D representation of the document embeddings. This helps in understanding how documents are clustered in the embedding space.
