# Introduction to RAG Chatbots

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots combine the power of large language models with information retrieval techniques to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base.
2. **Generation**: The retrieved documents are then used as context to generate a response using a language model.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Up-to-date information**: By using a knowledge base, RAG chatbots can provide current information without retraining the model.
- **Reduced hallucination**: Grounding responses in retrieved documents helps reduce false information.
- **Domain specialization**: RAG chatbots can be specialized for specific domains by curating relevant knowledge bases.

## Applications

RAG chatbots are particularly useful in:

- Customer support
- Educational platforms
- Research assistance
- Technical documentation search
